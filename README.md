# Modular Ability & Status Effect System

A short, 2D, UI-driven wave defense game built to showcase a **modular, data-driven ability and status effect system** in Unity. Players survive waves of incoming damage by strategically activating abilities, managing cooldowns, and stacking buffs/debuffs to gain the upper hand.
